# E-mail Users

## Description

Plugin for Omeka Classic. Once installed and active, allows to contact site's users via e-mail.

Settings allow to add a prefix to the e-mail Subject (e.g.: the site's name), and a header and footer to the e-mail Text; it's also possible to force text only use for the e-mail Text.

E-mail can be saved as a draft, to be edited and sent at a later time.

## Installation
Uncompress files and rename plugin folder "EmailUsers".

Then install it like any other Omeka plugin.
